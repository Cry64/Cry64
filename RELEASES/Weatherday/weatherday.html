          <a id="title">Weatherday Interview</a>
          <br><br>
          Weatherday is the alternative noise pop / emo project from Sweedish musician Sputnik. Following their widely acclaimed 2019 release "Come In", 
          their latest release is a collaborative EP with fellow emo musician Asian Glow. The pair combine forces to create a cathartic masterpiece drenched in colour, the result of which being "Weatherglow".
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"How did your relationship with Asian Glow come to be, did you always intend on creating a project together?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"We had both known of each other’s music for a long while, but we first started talking last fall when I contacted him on Twitter. It wasn’t with the intention to collaborate but we started talking about the idea of it pretty quickly and soon got to work on some basic ideas we sent to each other".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"Assuming the collaboration was done remotely, what was the creative process like during the making of Weatherglow? Did you find it at all frustrating not being in the same space?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"We had a back and forth with updates on the tracks we were working on. The overall process was pretty straightforward for the most part, where we would have a solid base we liked and then we added vocals and additional instrumentals on it, pretty much. I thought the distance was a positive, since I like working alone and having control over when I work and how I do it (having very unconventional hours for my workdays)".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What strengths do you think prevailed between you and Asian Glow during the creation of Weatherglow? Would you say you both have strengths in different areas of writing? And how do you think they they were displayed in the ep?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"It’s hard for me to be the judge of that, but I would say we had a good understanding of one another when it comes to songwriting and a good feel of how we both wanted the songs to sound when finished, which is an abstract thing you have to feel sometimes. That’s a strength I think did a lot for the cohesion of the album and made for an efficient process. We definitely have strengths in different areas, or I think the album wouldn’t sound any different from our respective outputs. Asian Glow’s sense for hectic moments is an example of one of the things I think I wouldn’t have been able to bring to the table as well. Our strengths were kind of naturally utilised in a way that complemented each other. We had a good read of what we were going for so we leaned extra much into what we could add to the mix rather than clash with it. And that’s what I think makes Weatherglow work as a collab".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What aspects of the ep do you think worked best, and what do you think didn’t? Are there any aspects from this ep you intend to include in your latest project?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"The best aspect is the way our sounds and styles gel, like I mentioned earlier. It’s such an important thing for a collab in my opinion, trying to make yourself sound like a unit while still keeping your individual identities prominent. I don’t think this was something that didn’t work, but leaning more heavily into a specific concept or theme might be interesting if we were to collab again. A clear concept could make for cool ways to showcase the similarities and differences between us, which always elevates a collab. For my upcoming album, I think I have gotten some valuable experience from Weatherglow, so I can totally see some aspects possibly affecting the album".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"How did you go about writing lyrics for the album, did you both have core concepts in mind before you started writing? "</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"We discussed concepts when we first considered working together. For the actual project we didn’t actively talk about anything like that, and we made our lyrics fully separately, but I feel like we both have carried common ground into our lyrics and for the overall feeling. I think it would be interesting to explore something more intricate concept-wise if we were to make music together again".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What creative aspects are you and Asian Glow similar in, and in which ways are you different? How do you contrast each other?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I think we both might have a similar way of seeing songs when it comes to big picture things, both being solo musicians that typically make every part of our songs by ourselves. That is something that can either prove to be an obstacle or common ground when working together with those similar to you in that way. Honestly, there are a bunch of smaller things that differ between us, as with everyone, but I don’t think I have a satisfying concise answer to that. I think a lot of it might be things you can pick up on by listening to our respective music. The contrast probably lies in that. The differences from us having different experiences in life, being from different countries, having different sounds, but all of that simultaneously being similar for us. The golden ratio of contrast".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"If you can pick one, what do you think your favourite idea from Weatherglow is, and how did this idea come about?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"Personally, I’m very happy with a specific moment in Melt a Bed. In the second half of the song there’s a brief part of a pop song being played. The idea behind it is that it’s a song that exists in the universe of Melt a Bed. The lyrics in the part that’s right before it are the same, which hints at the vocals pretty much quoting that pop song. So in Melt a Bed there’s basically a reference/homage to a song that “doesn’t actually exist”. The idea came from me writing those lyrics to be especially formal in the language of pop music, the lines almost feel like they were written just for the rhymes to work. So I thought of that concept because of that, and the way it was realised was exactly how I pictured it in my mind".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What aspects of Asian Glow’s music do you admire, and what are your favourite songs from their discography?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"There’s a lot to admire, but if I were to keep it reasonably brief I’d say that I adore the songwriting managing to go in so many directions while still being cohesive and keeping the listener’s focus. The level of interesting ideas is so refreshing! I also adore the aesthetic you get both visually and sonically from Asian Glow. As for favourite songs, that changes often (when it comes to any artist, really) for me, but right now I’d say: pt.2345678andstill, Cycles, No Exit and A Big Karismatic Dukie".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What inspired Weatherglow’s cover art, and what do the characters on it represent?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I wanted to make something that looked interesting, plainly speaking. I liked the cold, but familiar looking, feeling of the background and wanted two characters on top of it. I wanted there to be a palpable atmosphere between them, so I drew them in a way where there is sort of a tension there. It’s not at all clear what the tension comes from but you can see that it’s there, which I like about it. The character don’t represent anything in particular, I just wanted them to be striking and maybe memorable. The way one of the characters has the head of a cat, but not even an anatomically correct cat (it looks almost like a mascot), and an unusually long neck contrasts the human character, which I thought would help convey the tension. I also like drawing surreal stuff, as seen in the Weatherday related artwork as well, so it came naturally to me overall".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"It’s not often you see someone pave the way for an entirely new sound on their first album. How long had you been writing before releasing come in, and how can you compare your first songs to your most recent ones?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I had been writing the lyrics for one year, and then I made instrumentals for the lyrics which took a year as well. So in total it took around two years to write Come In. Before Come In, I had some experience making music in other genres between 2015-2017. Nothing too substantial, but I think that experience helped me be more efficient with the actual recording process for Come In, cause I knew how to work in GarageBand for iOS thanks to that experience. My early songwriting was not good, from what I heard. It made me a bit insecure so I stopped showing others my music for a while after that, and the following things I made were permanently deleted after I finished them. Some lost song melodies and lyrics remain in my head, vividly. A couple of them made their way onto Come In. I might find use for those remaining ones someday".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"When writing such dense music, do you ever find you struggle with creative blocks? If so, how do you get around them?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I haven’t had any creative blocks when it comes to music, but there are things that help me be more productive, which I find overlap with the tips people tend to give those who have creative blocks. The things that help are so different depending on who you are. Some find help in attempting a stream of consciousness-type of writing, that leaves no room for expectation or analysis, which makes it easier to get going when writing actual songs (if the stream of consciousness didn’t already provide good ideas). Some get great results by writing from a different perspective than the typical “start with a chord progression”, instead maybe starting by making a bass line or a melody for example".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"It’s not surprising to see people blown away by the density and colour of your music. Did you find it intimidating creating such a dense album like Come In, and what inspired you to write in such a way?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I was tired of listening to a bunch of things that were minimalistic and/or withholding, so I wanted to make something that was overwhelming and difficult (within the realm of “digestible music”). Something that would turn someone off if it wasn’t for them, and not just leave them feeling indifferent. That turned out to be Come in. Whenever I see someone have no opinion at all about the album, just indifference, I feel for a moment that I failed at making something meaningful. It doesn’t matter for my personal connection to my music though, I love everything I’ve released when I see it from my own perspective. I was sure about my choices for the songwriting, so the intimidation was just there from my insecurities lying in making music at all after having my confidence severely deteriorated over the years prior to its release".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"How much of your creative process is driven by deadlines? In light of your two most recent solo projects, which seem to have been under self-imposed deadlines."</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I work in intense bursts, when I sort of hyper fixate on an idea. Insane deadlines like the 3 days I used for making forgetmenot (under my Five Pebbles alias) bring that out of me. It’s like a cheat code I can use. I do prefer to have more time though, since I tend to change things several times during my process, often after being initially finished with something. Water Dreamer The Same (from Come In) has had 8 wildly different finished versions, for example. Another example, from a Come In song, is that I chose to cut 6 minutes off My Sputnik Sweetheart right before releasing the album".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What are your favourite and least favourite songs/song concepts you've made, and do you ever feel it’s hard to live up to the concepts you have in mind?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"One favourite of mine is the lyrics of Come In, I don’t know how I made them work the way they do, because my literary skills are definitely not as impressive as they have to be to make something like that (at least according to me). The album is written through a three-perspectives-at-once lens. At practically all times the lyrics have three different meanings and/or points of view, and I manage storylines that overlap like a multi-plot movie as well as sometimes using the “unreliable narrator” for some parts that are overlapping with honest and accurate depictions for the same lyrics. I could go on for an eternity about it all, so I’ll stop myself before I start sounding obnoxious. I am genuinely proud of the lyrical accomplishment on Come In, even if it might be something only I will understand the extent of. It’s the true hero of the album and its crowning achievement".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"Another favourite is the Five Pebbles EP forgetmenot, as a whole. It has a very special place in my heart and it’s incredibly personal to me. I know I succeeded with it because it hurts when I listen to it. That EP also shows me that I have more to explore with my music. After Come In got listeners I started viewing it differently, because it wasn’t just my album anymore, it kind of belongs to the listeners too. That made me unsure of my ability to stay true to myself in my expression. Five Pebbles put those worries to rest and gave me what I was missing at the time. The concepts I have in my mind are always difficult to materialise, but I’m happy as long as it’s close enough that I can see what I was thinking. Sometimes things need compromises to be translated to music or lyrics, but that’s just the reality of things, yet I try to avoid making them if I can. I don’t let any ideas or concepts be released without me doing them justice".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What sound do you see your music heading towards in the future, will you be taking any ideas from forgetmenot?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"I don’t look too far in the future. Each release could be my last, and that’s how I like viewing it. Come In was supposed to be the only thing I did, it was my life goal to make an album I was happy with and to release it. By releasing Come In, I have completed the last thing I’ve wanted to do in my lifetime, I can die knowing I lived my life to the fullest. Hornet Disaster, which is the second LP I’m releasing as Weatherday, is the first major project I’ve worked on since Come In (judged by the scale and importance of it to me). That album is as far as I’m willing to think, release-wise, as of today. I have no plans of making another album as Weatherday after that until I know that I want to for sure, which could be the same day as I release Hornet Disaster or a year later, or even 10 years later. Realistically speaking, however, I wouldn’t be surprised if I decide to make another album and that it would be finished within the 2020’s. As for ideas from forgetmenot, I made that project under a new name for several reasons, one of them being that it’s a different sound from my other projects. I will probably not make something that sounds like Five Pebbles under any other name than Five Pebbles, but my experience from making that EP will undoubtedly make its way into anything else I do. Just like with any other project I have".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What music are you listening to right now, are there any new found artists / albums you can recommend?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"Since I’m currently working intensely on Hornet Disaster, I am almost only listening to my own music for reference. Other than that, I’ve been listening to a lot of Bladee, Number Girl, Birds Fear Death, Ecco2k, The Knife, Astrobrite, WHY?, Morning Effort, Snowing and Darkle recently. I recommend all of those, they’re all amazing".</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="me-talking">"What is in your fridge rn?"</span>
          <br><br>
          <span class="artist-talking">"Anything you can think of that sparkles".</span>
